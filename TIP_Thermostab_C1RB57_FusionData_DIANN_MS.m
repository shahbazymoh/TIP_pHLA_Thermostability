% EXAMPLE DATASET: C1R-B*57:01 data acquired by Fusion Orbitrap (Thermo)

% DIA-NN version 1.8.0 was used for library-based DIA data processing
% Compatible with the next versions of DIA-NN (e.g., 1.8.1 or 1.9.2)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*************** IMPORTANT ***************%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input files: Please search your DIA data by DIA-NN (*MBR option should be uncheck) 
% and use the "report.tsv" to organize and manupulate the results in a new "csv" file 
% according to the example "data_table" below (imported data in the 1st step)
